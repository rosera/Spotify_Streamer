# Spotify_Streamer

Spotify Streamer - Project 1 of the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree. Note this project was replaced with the (imho superior) popular movies project.

The second project in this assignment adds a music player that will use the Spotify API to play a snippet of the selected track. In addition, the interface is retrofitted with a tablet UI. 

## Getting Started

The application provides a means to utilise the Spotify API and access information regarding popular artists. The interface allows the user to enter an artist and then see the associate groups and titles representing a top ten of hits.

### Prerequisites

The project requires access to the Spotify API (Apparently this is geo locked) to compile and run.
